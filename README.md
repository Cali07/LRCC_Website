# Give & Get Hunger Hack Platform

Give & Get is a mobile-first web platform designed for the **KFC Add Hope Biggest Hunger Hack**.

## üåç Vision
*"Get discounts, feed children, and see the impact in real-time."*

Users claim **discount codes** from partner companies. Before receiving their code, they are **optionally prompted to donate** to feed a child through KFC Add Hope.  
Donors and investors then **see exactly how their funds are used**, with:
- **Real-time dashboards** showing meals delivered.
- **Impact videos** from communities.
- **AI-powered hunger hotspot maps** predicting areas at risk.

Meanwhile, KFC centers use the **admin portal** to:
- Report daily meal distribution data.
- Manage funds and donations.
- Use **AI route optimization** to deliver meals faster and more efficiently.
